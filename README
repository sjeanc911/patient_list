Notes for app:
- similar to indicator_list_view in reporting app
- app name : patient_list
- tutorial source
http://coenraets.org/blog/2011/12/backbone-js-wine-cellar-tutorial-part-1-getting-started/

What I need :
Server side
- Patient model, attibutes
- CRUDE methods

Client side
- patient model
- patient list/collections model
- add, edit, delete, update patient
- patient view

Things to learn :
- including and initializing backbone and underscore in the app
- creating backbone models and views, and demonstrating how they work
- creating a collection of models, and demonstrating how they work
- using localStorage?


Creating the app :
- using rails 3.0.9, haml 3.1.2
- rails new indicators -d mysql #create rails app
- rake db:create # create db
- rails s # start the web server

- dl the js requirements : backbone, underscore, jquery and include
  them in the app (include dl sources)
- optionally, you can use ich and mustache for templating
- test from browser console if they are properly loaded
- templates are the views we are going to use for the backbone model
  and views later on
- create a sample template and insert them in the app, so that we can call
  them later when needed
- one way is to put them in the layout
- check if the templates are properly loaded
